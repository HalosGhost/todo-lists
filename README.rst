 TODO Lists
============

In this repository are some (minorly) organized todo lists of projects I hope to eventually get around to.
Some of the projects have already begun, others it will take me a long time to work up to.
While the files here imply that I will eventually begin work on all these projects, should people be inspired to work on any of the potential projects listed here, they should feel welcome to do so; I only ask that they contact me so that I might help out along the way.
