 Browsers
==========

- [ ] Daemon (?)

  - [ ] Fetch pages with ``libcurl``/similar into a cache
  - [ ] Walk a cached page to create a data structure of page resources (?)

This is an interesting idea; it separates the online part of the internet from browsing.
This makes security much simpler to accomplish (this almost feels like a slightly more automated version of the `RMS browsing method <http://lwn.net/Articles/262570/>`_).
It also separates the components of a browser into the page fetcher and the renderer (possibility to support multiple front-ends easily).
However, this could easily mean the downfall of some common functionality without extra work (e.g., logging into a website).
